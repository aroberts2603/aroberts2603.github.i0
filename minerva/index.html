            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>My project is creating a fast, lightweight, and educational prototyping programming language with C like syntax. Its purpose is to allow simple testing of important programming concepts with documentation to help explain them, or just be used as a prototyping language closer to C and Java in style.</p>

            <h2>Research Requirements</h2>
            <p>I will have to research further into programming language concepts such as inheritance, scope, classes, and more to be able to implement them into my language. Additionally I’ll research things like regular expressions, scanning, parsing, and interpreting to build my language. The optimization of my programming language will be a time sink if I finish everything else early, with lots of available research and improvement.</p>

            <h2>Technology Needed</h2>
            <p>Technology I’ll learn to use includes the IDE IntelliJ to program my project and Git as version control system. I plan to have a website dedicated to my language containing file downloads, code examples, and documentation.</p>

            <h2>Final Presentation</h2>
            <p>My presentation will talk about the basic things necessary to build a language, a tour of my website, and examples of documentation. During my presentation I’ll do a side by side comparison of a simple program such as a calculator in multiple languages (for example, Java, C/C++, my language, and Python) to show where it stands between them to highlight benefits of my language and acknowledge drawbacks. We’ll know if my project is a success if simple programs can be written quickly by new programmers using the support my website provides. To test this, I’ll have an interactive segment of my presentation where someone with little to no programming experience can download my language and write a “hello world” program using my documentation in 5 minutes or less.</p>

            <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Greatly improve my mastery of Java and C/C++ programming languages</li>
                <li>Vastly increase my knowledge of the anatomy and design of programming languages</li>
                <li>Gain a better understanding of the computer science career path to help me decide if I want to pursue it as a career</li>
                <li>Improve communication skills, especially while explaining abstract or complicated programming concepts</li>
                <li>Develop more efficient time management and planning skills while working on long term projects with few deadlines</li>
            </ul>
